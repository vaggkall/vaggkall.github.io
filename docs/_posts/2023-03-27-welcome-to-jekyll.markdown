## San Francisco database on Public Safety 
The analysis is based on the San Francisco Police Department's Incident Reports Historical dataset. The dataset offers a glimpse into San Francisco's public safety over the years, containing detailed records of police incident reports spanning back to 2003. From incidents of theft and vandalism to more serious offenses such as assault and homicide, the dataset covers a wide range of criminal activity and incidents that have occurred in the city. With information on the date, time, location, and other relevant details for each reported incident, the dataset is a valuable resource for researchers, analysts, and law enforcement agencies alike, providing insights into crime patterns, trends, and policy decisions.


## Narcotics in the different SF districts 
Narcotics, also known as drugs or controlled substances, are chemicals that have psychoactive effects on the brain and central nervous system. Many narcotics have a high potential for abuse and addiction, leading to negative consequences for individuals, families, and communities. In San Francisco, the issue with narcotics is not new. Despite ongoing efforts to address drug abuse and addiction, the city continues to struggle with high rates of drug-related crime.

The above visualization reveals Tenderloin as the district with the highest number of drug crimes. This information does not come as a surprise since the district is widely recognized for its drug-related issues. As explained in an [article by Kevin Fagan](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/tenderloin-sam-quinones-17700387.php) in the San Francisco Chronicles, witnessing the consumption of fentanyl and methamphetamine during a stroll in the Tenderloin district is considered a commonplace occurrence.

The diagram presents a comparison of narcotics-related crimes in two areas of San Francisco, Tenderloin and Ingleside, from 2009 to 2017. It can be observed that in 2009, the number of narcotics-related crimes was higher in Tenderloin than in Ingleside. However, over the years, there was a gradual decrease in the number of crimes in both areas.

Notably, in 2017, there was a substantial drop in the number of narcotics-related crimes in Tenderloin, with a decrease of almost 75% from the previous year. Despite this significant decrease, the number of narcotics-related crimes in Tenderloin was still higher than in Ingleside in 2017.

Overall, the diagram indicates a gradual reduction in narcotics-related crimes in both Tenderloin and Ingleside areas over the years. However, there is still a higher prevalence of these crimes in Tenderloin, which may require continued attention from law enforcement agencies and policymakers to address the issue effectively.

The 24-hour distribution of narcotics crime in Tenderloin shows that these types of crimes occur throughout the day and night. However, there are certain peak periods when narcotics crimes are more likely to occur. From the data, it appears that the highest frequency of narcotics crime occurs during the afternoon and evening hours, peaking between 1 pm to 6 pm. This pattern could be explained by several factors, such as the availability of drugs during these hours and the increased foot traffic in the city during the afternoon and evening hours. It is also possible that these peak periods coincide with periods of increased drug-related activity, such as drug sales or drug use in public areas.

Another interesting finding from the 24-hour distribution of narcotics crime in Tenderloin is the relatively low frequency of these crimes during the early morning hours between midnight to 6 am. This pattern could be explained by several factors, such as the lower foot traffic and activity during these hours, or a greater police presence in certain areas. The 24-hour distribution of narcotics crime in Tenderloin highlights the importance of understanding the patterns and factors that contribute to these crimes, in order to develop more effective strategies for preventing and addressing narcotics crime in the city.
