# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible

  The analysis is based on the San Francisco Police Department’s Incident Reports Historical dataset. The dataset offers a glimpse into San Francisco’s public safety over the years, containing detailed records of police incident reports spanning back to 2003. From incidents of theft and vandalism to more serious offenses such as assault and homicide, the dataset covers a wide range of criminal activity and incidents that have occurred in the city. With information on the date, time, location, and other relevant details for each reported incident, the dataset is a valuable resource for researchers, analysts, and law enforcement agencies alike, providing insights into crime patterns, trends, and policy decisions. <In this analysis, the focus will be on narcotics data.> (different font or color to make it visible to the eye)
